You are a bored space janitor who accidentally gets into a spaceship and launches into a war zone. You have no idea what you are doing, but the ship has some blasters. You must blast your way through hordes of angry aliens who want to destroy Earth for some reason. As you near their hivemind, the waves increase, the asteroids increase, everything increases. Can you become the Galactic Defender?

Pillage the incoming enemies to advance levels, the speed of the lag/laser and frequency of aliens increase as levels are completed. When the enemies reach the other end of the screen, player loses a life. Moreover, the rocks and red laser instantly kill the player on contact
